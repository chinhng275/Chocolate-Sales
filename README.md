## Overview
The Chocolate Sales Analysis project visualizes a 2022 sales dataset for a chocolate business, focusing on chocolate products sold across multiple countries by various salespersons. The dataset, stored in Chocolate Sale.csv, is analyzed and visualized using Power BI, with a multi-page dashboard covering a summary overview, country-level insights, quarterly trends, and salesperson performance. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the dashboard pages (Summary, Country, Quarter, Sales Person), the visualizations on each page, their purposes, and the insights they deliver to support data-driven decisions for optimizing chocolate sales, inventory management, and marketing strategies.

## Purpose
The primary goals of this project are to:
- Provide a high-level summary of chocolate sales performance metrics for 2022.
- Analyze sales and shipping volumes across countries to identify key markets.
- Identify quarterly sales trends to detect seasonal patterns in chocolate sales.
- Evaluate salesperson performance to recognize top performers and identify areas for improvement.
- Enable stakeholders to interact with the data through slicers for dynamic filtering across Country, Product, Quarter, and Sales Person.
